🧠 How It Works
The script randomly selects one line from each of the three arrays:

firstVerses

secondVerses

thirdVerses

These are combined into a full message and displayed inside an element with the class .verse. Triggered by a button with the ID button.

🖌️ Customization
You can personalize or expand the verse content by editing the arrays in script.js. Just add more entries to increase variation.
